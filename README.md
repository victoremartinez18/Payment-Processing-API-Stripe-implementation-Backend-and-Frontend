## Features üöÄ

- **API Controller and Service Files:** Developed using .NET and C#, these files establish the communication channel with the Stripe API. Validation of the Stripe account occurs through a unique identifier token, generated using a combination of private and public keys. This token creates a session-specific link for payment processing.

- **React Component:** Implemented in JavaScript, this component serves as the front end of the project. Upon clicking the Checkout button, the API controller initiates a session and generates a payment link. Additionally, a payload is created, detailing the list of products and the total amount to be paid.

- **Customizable Integration:** Designed for easy integration into any web application with minimal adjustments.

## Additional Functionality üõ†Ô∏è

- **Balance Management and Bank Transfers:** Users have the option to manage balances and initiate transfers to bank accounts through the web application. Alternatively, these tasks can be performed directly through the Stripe Dashboard.
